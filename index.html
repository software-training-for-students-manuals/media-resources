            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>This manual is a collection of media resources you may find helpful when creating an audio, video, print, or digital work.</p>
            <p>Many of the sites include assets that are <em>royalty free</em>, which means you can use or modify them without attribution or worrying about getting into legal trouble.</p>
            <p>If you are plan to use copyrighted works in your project, be sure to consult the section below, regarding copyright and fair use.</p>

            <h1>What About Copyrighted Material?</h1>
            <p>Using other people's creative work can be tricky. Copyright is a complex subject, and if you plan to use any copyrighted or otherwise non-royalty-free media assets, you will usually need to at the very least give attribution or cite where the work came from.</p>
            <p>Most academic use of copyrighted material is covered by something called <em>fair use</em>, which means that works can be used in academic work without running into issues with the law as long as only a certain amount is used.</p>
            <p>This article from Stanford goes into a good amount of detail about fair use of copyrighted material in the context of academic work:</p>

            <h3>Cheat Sheet</h3>
            <p>Here is a quick cheat sheet of what can be used for different types of work and still be considered fair use:</p>
            <table>

            <h2>Searching For Images and Copyright Laws</h2>
            <p>When searching for images online, many of the tools we use (such as Google Images) will return the most relevant results for our search - including copyrighted or unlicensed images. Copyrighted images are protected under law, which means that <strong>if you publish copyrighted images - even in something like a post on a personal blog - the owner of the copyright can sue you</strong>. There is even something of <a href="https://www.contentfac.com/copyright-infringement-penalties-are-scary/" target="_blank">a cottage industry around suing people who infringe on copyrighted images</a> - even if they do so unknowingly because they found them by searching online.</p>

           <p>For a more in-depth explanation of copyright and usage of images available online, <a href="https://www.rivaliq.com/blog/guide-copyright-fair-use-laws-online-images/" target="_blank">check out this article that goes into more details and real-world situations around copyright.</a></p>
           
            <p>Certain exceptions to copyright law exist that grant limited use of a copyrighted work if that usage benefits the public, known as <em>fair use</em>. <strong>Fair use applies to things like news reporting, criticism/commentary, and using copyrighted works for educational purpose.</strong> Most of the time if you are using assignments for assignments for class that could be argued as fair use, but it is still important to make sure to your due diligence in finding and using pictures online.</p>
            
            <p>Some of the ways to avoid this are to limit your search to licensed images only, or to use search tools that specifically index royalty-free assets.</p>
            <h3>Wikimedia Commons</h3>
            <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page</a></p>
            <p>Wikimedia is a user-generated collection of open source, royalty-free, and otherwise okay-to-use media assets. As the name suggests, it is basically like Wikipedia but for media resources.</p>
            <h3>Creative Commons Search</h3>
            <p><a href="https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org" target="_blank">https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org</a></p>
            <p>Creative Commons (CC) is a type of licensing that allows people to use or re-use images that are licensed under it. There are a few different varieties of CC that can apply to a resource.</p>
            <h3>Google Image Search Usage Rights</h3>
            <p><a href="https://images.google.com/" target="_blank">https://images.google.com/</a></p>
            <img src="images/tools-usage-rights.png" class="float-right medium " alt="Screenshot showing the Usage Rights options in the Google Image Search interface">
            <p>When using Google Image Search to find image, you can limit your results to only include images that fit particular licenses for re-use. To do this, click the <strong>Tools</strong> menu below the search bar and choose the <strong>Usage Rights</strong> option.</p>
            <p>This will help you avoid images that are clearly not licensed for public use. Because it relies on automated search algorithms and user reports to determine the licensing for a given image, it is not a foolproof way to avoid copyright infringment - but it's definitely better than the default Google Image search, and is a good place to start!</p>
